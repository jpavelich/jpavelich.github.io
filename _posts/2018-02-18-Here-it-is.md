I've finally taken the plunge and begun to rebuild the homepage. After much time and consideration of different services, I decided to power my site with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

I love writing in **markdown** and really value the free hosting. Plus, it gets me back into Github and the command line, and was really easy to set up.
